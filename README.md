# AI Code Review System

A monorepo for automated code review using AI.

## Data Flows

### 1. When a User Installs the Bot to a Repository

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant GitHub
    participant Web as apps/web
    participant WS as services/webhook-service
    participant DB as packages/db
    participant RI as services/repo-indexer

    User->>Web: User initiates GitHub App installation
    Web->>GitHub: Redirect to GitHub OAuth
    GitHub->>Web: OAuth callback with installation token
    Note over Web,GitHub: User selects repositories to install

    GitHub->>WS: Webhook: installation created
    WS->>DB: Create installation record
    DB-->>WS: Installation created

    loop For each repository
        WS->>DB: Upsert repository
    end

    WS->>RI: Add job to repo-index queue
    RI->>GitHub: Fetch repository files
    RI->>RI: Generate embeddings
    RI->>RI: Store in vector database
```

### 2. When a User Raises a Pull Request

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant GitHub
    participant WS as services/webhook-service
    participant DB as packages/db
    participant PP as services/pr-processor
    participant RI as services/repo-indexer
    participant AIR as services/ai-review-worker
    participant GCS as services/github-comment-service

    User->>GitHub: Creates/opens PR
    GitHub->>WS: Webhook: pull_request opened

    WS->>DB: Find repository
    DB-->>WS: Repository found
    WS->>PP: Add job to pr-review queue

    PP->>GitHub: Get PR details & diff
    PP->>DB: Create review record (status: pending)
    PP->>RI: Add job to pr-context queue
    PP->>GCS: Add job to pr-comment (initial comment)

    GCS->>GitHub: Post "processing" comment

    RI->>RI: Fetch similar code from vector store
    RI->>AIR: Add job to pr-ai-review queue

    AIR->>AIR: Generate AI code review
    AIR->>DB: Update review record (status: completed)
    AIR->>GCS: Add job to pr-issues queue
    AIR->>GCS: Add job to pr-comment (summary)

    GCS->>GitHub: Post inline comments for each issue
    GCS->>GitHub: Post summary comment
```

### Build

To build all apps and packages, run the following command:

```sh
pnpm build
```

### Develop

To develop all apps and packages, run the following command:

```sh
pnpm dev
```

You can develop a specific package by using a filter:
